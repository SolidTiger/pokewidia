        <h1>Data</h1>
        Pokéwidia is powered by PokéApi which provides data from the Pokémon games. <br>
        A big thanks to the creators of the API. The API allows us to fetch JSON objects <br>
        containing data about specific Pokémons. The data used by us concerns Pokémon stats, type, name, and ID. <br>
        You can find the API and more information at: <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">https://pokeapi.co/</a>

        <h2>Our Learning Objectives</h2>

        <p><b>Design:</b> We conducted this project as a part of our information visualization course to achieve the following learning outcomes:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The steps of the visualization pipeline by Mezza.</li>
            <li>The seven tasks of data visualization by Shneiderman.</li>
            <li>Several visualization models like radar charts, scatter plots, and dynamic tables.</li>
            <li>Suitable design elements and color selection for effective visualization.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><b>Defend:</b> We defended our design choices during live sessions across the project with proper justifications based on available literature and best practices.</p>
        
        <p><b>Critique:</b> We provided constructive criticism to other projects in addition to providing improvement suggestions and alternative approaches when available.</p>
        
        <p><b>Demonstrate:</b> We presented our progress and conducted live demos of our visualization tool to audiences of students, colleagues, and experts.</p>
        
        <p><b>Evaluate:</b> We managed to get feedback on our tool through interviews, focus group discussions, an online questionnaire and recorded expert testing. Then we implemented changes and enhancements to our tool based on the received points.</p>
        
        <h3>Learned Lessons</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>To tightly manage the scope of the project and narrow down the obtained data to suit the scope. Finding a good source of data was one crucial aspect of this project's success.</li>
            <li>Choosing a suitable visual representation for multi-dimensional data requires several rounds of trials, user testing, and enhancement. Still, it is difficult to find one solution that fits all, and here comes the importance of having a good user requirements analysis and using personas to cross-validate the development.</li>
            <li>Merging individual parts into the main visualization is a time-consuming task that needs close monitoring and follow-up. A good approach to plan for the splitting and merging of tasks at the same time to capture all the dependencies.</li>
            <li>Making good use of space is a challenging task, especially when viewing the tool using different screen sizes and resolutions. A solution would be to have adaptive content that could be viewed on different screens or to mention the best resolution for the tool to the users.</li>
        </ul>
